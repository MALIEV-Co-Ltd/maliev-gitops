# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

This feature formalizes the process for onboarding and managing applications within the existing ArgoCD-based GitOps repository. The technical approach relies on the established Kustomize `base`/`overlays` pattern, with ArgoCD managing the deployment synchronization.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: YAML (for Kubernetes manifests)
**Primary Dependencies**: Kubernetes, ArgoCD, Kustomize, External Secrets Operator
**Storage**: Google Secret Manager (for application secrets)
**Testing**: Manual validation of deployments via ArgoCD UI and kubectl
**Target Platform**: Kubernetes
**Project Type**: GitOps Repository
**Performance Goals**: New deployments sync within 5 minutes.
**Constraints**: All application and infrastructure changes must be managed via Git pull requests.
**Scale/Scope**: The system is designed to support at least 50 microservices.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **I. No Secrets in Git**: PASS. The specification requires using the External Secrets Operator.
- **II. Git as the Single Source of Truth**: PASS. The specification is entirely based on a Git-centric workflow.
- **III. Environment Configuration via Kustomize Overlays**: PASS. The specification mandates the use of Kustomize overlays.
- **IV. Declarative, Automated Deployments with ArgoCD**: PASS. The specification requires ArgoCD for all deployments.

**Result**: All principles are upheld. No violations.

### Source Code (repository root)

This feature is process-oriented and does not involve changes to the source code structure of the repository itself. The relevant structure is the documentation generated within the `specs/` directory.

**Structure Decision**: No changes to the source code structure are required.

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
